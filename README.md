<h1><b>Theme-Title:</b> Apple Website all the way back to 90's</h1>

<h2><b>What if Apple company made their website retro mode?</b></h2>

This is my retro-styled website for Apple Company created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used the existing apple products and images in the website as I wanted to give users the feel of the above question.

<b>Design Features:</b> Heavy design yet minimal like an 90's website design should be like. Minimal animation showcasing the beginning of the shift from physical stores/showroom to online stores/showroom. Minimal text designs only necessary ones. 

<b>Functionalities:</b>
<ul>
<li>Navigation from current webpage to the target webpage using search button and keyboard enter. When the user input matches any of the possible search inputs that gets mapped with it's respective webpage.</li>
<li>Navigation to webpages via navbar, footer and anchor tags.</li> 
<li>Upon getting the user input, getting predefined FAQs if the user input matches any word of the predefined questions.</li>
</ul>
<b>Learning Experience:</b> As of now I am not sure if I should rate myself as an intermediate developer. My skills being beginner or intermediate, one thing is for sure I learned a lot of different features of HTML CSS and javaScript which was unknown to me in my journey of becoming a fully fledged full-stack developer. This hackathon really helped me brush of my skills.


<b>Special Thanks:</b> A big thanks to <a href="https://www.codedex.io/home">@Codedex</a> for this amazing opportunity and for being such a great host to all of us.
